# 2-10. Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and
# add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write
# because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and
# the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence
# describing what the program does.
