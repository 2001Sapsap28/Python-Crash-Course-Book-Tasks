The sheer joy of making things.
The pleasure of making things that are useful to other people.
The fascination of fashioning complex puzzle-like objects of interlocking moving parts, and watching them work in subtle cycles, playing out the consequences of principles built in from the beginning.
Being challenged constantly.
It is a fair competition with a clean goal.
